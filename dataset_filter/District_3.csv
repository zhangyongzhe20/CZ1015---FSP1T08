Not only can you enjoy Downtown and the sights, which are located within a few blocks of my place, you can live like a local in Capitol Hill.   Capitol Hill is where the best restaurants, bars, and cafes in Seattle are located.  If you're looking to hit the bars, parks or sights or want to try a different coffee shop within a block each day of the week, you've found the right place.  I personally enjoy Victrola Coffee, Purr and CC'attles bars, and Kada Makna, a Malaysian restaurant 2 blocks away.

We welcome everyone here but we expect those who come visit our neighborhood to respect our community.

Looking for something specific? Just ask - I'd be happy to point you in the right direction!","The apartment is right on several major bus lines.

It's a five minute walk to some of the best (and some of the trendiest) restaurants and bars Seattle has to offer, but my immediate neighborhood is very quiet and residential.  So it's a great spot to retreat to when you are done with the hustle and bustle and want to get some rest and relaxation.  It's also within walking distance to Volunteer Park, which is a great spot for a stroll, you can walk up the water tower for a view of the city and the lakes, and if it's clear, you'll see the Olympic mountains, the Cascade mountains and Mt. Rainier.","There is great public transit just two blocks from my house.  There are two buses that run directly downtown to Pioneer Square and to the Pike/Pine market and shopping areas.  There are also buses that go over to UW and various other locations.

We benefit from being right next to Capitol Hill, but without the noise and density.  We are nestled between northeast Capitol Hill, the north Central District, Madison Park, and Madrona neighborhoods. We are located near the south entrance of the amazing Arboretum Park, which contains the miles of walking trails through woods and marshes, as well as the beautiful Japanese Gardens.  The Arboretum connects with University of Washington campus, where you can rent canoes and row boats.  We are also just a short walk from several of Lake Washington's trendiest swimming beaches!","Airport: Our house is easy to reach from Seatac Airport via public transportation.  You can take the Link Lightrail to the Mount Baker Station and transfer to the northbound #8 bus, or stay on the lightrail to Westlake Station and transfer to the eastbound #11 bus. Parking: there is plenty of free street parking on our quiet, dead-end street.  The spots right in front of our house are often open.  We also have a parking spot available in our alley, though it is sometimes muddy in the winter.  Please let us know if you'd like this spot and we'll save it for you. Public Transportation: Most of our guests get around great without renting a car.  We are just two blocks from the #11 bus line, which runs from Madison Park through Capitol Hill to Downtown Seattle every 15 minutes.  We are also near the 8, 2, 43, and 48 bus lines, which can connect you to Downtown Seattle, Seattle Center & Space Needle, Madrona, Queen Anne, University of Washington, and The Central District.

Madison Park also has a beach access to enjoy summer at the lake. If you head a bit further South of the house, you will find the Mt. Baker, Seward Park and Columbia City neighborhoods.
