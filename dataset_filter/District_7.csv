Belltown is the most densely populated neighborhood in Seattle, Washington, United States, located on the city's downtown waterfront on land that was artificially flattened as part of a regrading project. Formerly a low-rent, semi-industrial arts district, in recent decades it has transformed into a neighborhood of trendy restaurants, boutiques, nightclubs, and residential towers as well as warehouses and art galleries. The area is named after William Nathaniel Bell, on whose land claim the neighborhood was built. In 2007, CNNMoney named Belltown the best place to retire in the Seattle metro area, calling it ""a walkable neighborhood with everything you need."" 97/100 Walk Score These are things that you should probably do if you want to experience Seattle, and dont have that much time...and the $ it to do them: - Pike Plac","- Inquire about airport pickups  - Public transportation: major bus lines on 3rd avenue, light Rail station on 3rd Ave and Pike St. Look up the public transportation routes on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Maps - Uber or Lyft: The best way to get around if you're not driving is via Uber.

Belltown is the most densely populated neighborhood in Seattle, Washington, United States, located on the city's downtown waterfront on land that was artificially flattened as part of a regrading project. Formerly a low-rent, semi-industrial arts district, in recent decades it has transformed into a neighborhood of trendy restaurants, boutiques, nightclubs, and residential towers as well as warehouses and art galleries. The area is named after William Nathaniel Bell, on whose land claim the neighborhood was built. In 2007, CNNMoney named Belltown the best place to retire in the Seattle metro area, calling it ""a walkable neighborhood with everything you need."" 97/100 Walk Score These are things that you should probably do if you want to experience Seattle, and dont have that much time...and the $ it to do them: - Pike Plac","- Inquire about airport pickups  - Public transportation: major bus lines on 3rd avenue, light Rail station on 3rd Ave and Pike St. Look up the public transportation routes on (website hidden) Maps - Uber or Lyft: The best way to get around if you're not driving is via Uber. Uber is an App on your phone that let you order a private upscale taxi and have it arrive within minutes to wherever you are. All payments are automatic and you can see where your taxi is at all times. You can even review the route the driver took, rate your driver, or contact Uber's support team in case you are not satisfied. Service is superb and costs less than city run taxis.

Belltown is the most densely populated neighborhood in Seattle, Washington, United States, located on the city's downtown waterfront on land that was artificially flattened as part of a regrading project. Formerly a low-rent, semi-industrial arts district, in recent decades it has transformed into a neighborhood of trendy restaurants, boutiques, nightclubs, and residential towers as well as warehouses and art galleries. The area is named after William Nathaniel Bell, on whose land claim the neighborhood was built. In 2007, CNNMoney named Belltown the best place to retire in the Seattle metro area, calling it ""a walkable neighborhood with everything you need."" 97/100 Walk Score These are things that you should probably do if you want to experience Seattle, and dont have that much time...and the $ it to do them: - Pike Pla","- Inquire about airport pickups  - Public transportation: major bus lines on 3rd avenue, light Rail station on 3rd Ave and Pike St. Look up the public transportation routes on (website hidden) Maps - Uber or Lyft: The best way to get around if you're not driving is via Uber.

In this accommodation, cleaning is included in the nightly rate and, unlike staying in a hotel, there's no 17.9% hotel occupancy fee and state taxes.  Reserved, covered parking in the building is $20 a night.  Parking in the area costs upwards of $45 a day.  The price you see on the calendar plus AirBnB's commission is what you pay at booking. Once you book, there are no other costs ","Spacious Studio Condo, located just steps from all of down town Seattle's hot spots.  Walking distance to Pike Place Market and More.

Seattle Center (the plaza containing the Space Needle, EMP, Pacific Science Center, Key Arena, etc.) is about a 15 minute walk. Belltown is also an easy walk, just on the other side of Seattle Center - I walk to work in Belltown and it usually takes me about 25 minutes. Ballard and downtown are both a 10 minute trip on the Rapid Ride bus - there is a stop 3 blocks away. It's super quick and easy to get to Pike Place, the convention center, and the stadiums from here, and there are quite a few inexpensive transportation options to choose from.","Taxi: Uber, Sidecar, and Lyft are all available in Seattle. They're usually less expensive than taxis, but you'll need to download the apps to your smartphone in order to use them. You can get your first ride for free up to $20 by using the code uvgmm for Uber or libby111 for Lyft! Bus: There are bus stops all over - the closest ones are less than 5 mins walking. The cost is $2.50, cash only. Monorail/Light Rail: The monorail at the Space Needle is 15 mins walking, and that will take you to 5th x Pine downtown for $2 (cash only). From there you can cross the street to the light rail station for quick and cheap access to the stadiums, Amtrak station, and airport. The light rail kiosks accept both cash and credit cards. Bike: Seattle now has a bike share program called Pronto. 24 hour passes are $8, and 3-day passes are $16.

Pet friendly flooring, dog bed, kennel, and a fenced yard make this the perfect spot to vacation with your pups.   Beautifully furnished, luxury beds with feather toppers, patio with fenced yard, and all the details you need to make your stay perfect.  Our apartment has two bedroom (walls not shared) both with queen beds.  The living area features a flat screen TV, couch, and two of the ugliest recliners you have ever seen.   The kitchen is stocked for all your cooking needs, however, be prepared to do dishes the old fashioned way!  You will find all the condiments and extras on hand necessary, including coffee and creamer (priority uno).    Our one bathroom is updated with a  shower stall and new vanity.  What it lacks in space it makes up for in being well stocked.","We are 2 blocks away from the famous 'Frasier' view.  The top of Queen Anne is an historic and very walkable area.  There are great views from multiple lookouts, the most incredible homes to gawk at, bars, cafes, bookstores, salons, tea shops, and eateries to keep you busy.  Oh, and did I mention Trader Joe's and the cheapest cheese on the planet? Got dogs and kids?  That's fine by us, just let us know if we need to break out the high chair and packinplay.   You can easily walk downtown, waterfront, and pikes place if you are able bodied. ","Transportation:  If you aren't planning on renting a car (not necessary in my mind) we have some great options.   Airport Car Service: ABC Transport (phone number hidden)    The dispatchers could not be nicer and the rate is flat $35 (tip not included) to and from Seatac Airport.  The cars are huge old town cars and the drivers can be a bit rough around the edges but I've used them countless times. They are absolutely always on time both coming and going, and the extra trunk space for suit cases is great.  It is CHEAPER to use this service than to take a cab.  Just FYI. Around Seattle: UBER CAR SERVICE The Uber app connects you to a driver at the tap of a button.  Once the app is installed on your phone you can pull up a map to see the cars in your area.  When you install the app you will put in your payment information.  Once ready for a car simply pull up the app, drop a pin at your location, and wait for a car in the area to confirm they will pick you up.

A community within walking distance of Downto","A community within walking distance of Downtown, Queen Anne is situated just north of Seattle Center and south of Fremont across the Lake Washington Ship Canal.   As a neighborhood, Queen Anne can refer either to the entire hill or to the central residential and business district at the top of the hill. Lower Queen Anne, refers to the area at the southern base of the hill, just north and west of Seattle Center.   The district's name derives from the architectural style, typical of so many of the early houses in this area. The historic mansions are home to many of Seattle's economic and cultural elite.   In 1962, Lower Queen Anne became the site of the Century 21 Exposition, a World's Fair. The fairgrounds are now the campus of Seattle Center, home to the Space Needle, Pacific Science Center, EMP Museum, the north terminal of the Seattle Center monorail, and KeyArena, where the Seattle Storm plays. Newest to the Seattle Center campus is Chihuly Glass and Garden. Opened in Spring 2012 at",This apt is in the heart of the city - a 20 minute walk to downtown or a 6 minute walk into Fremont.

THREE MAJOR POINTS TO CONSIDER  ONE - Queen Anne is one of the closest neighborhoods to downtown as well as to the Space Needle and Seattle Center, a major cultural center and sightseeing area.  TWO - Queen Anne has some of the most incredible view points in the city due to being located on a hill.  THREE - although you are in a major city, it does not have a hectic, busy city feeling.   ","COMING BY CAR - There is one space reserved for you--back of the house under a covered carport. Parking is also convenient and free on the street with plenty of spaces available.  ON FOOT â€“ A car is not a necessity, unless you want to visit some outlying areas. For such occasion rent a car on a daily basis. PLACES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND CITY - are easy to get to by walking or taking the bus.  BUS SERVICES â€“ From Queen Anne bus services to the North, East, South and West.  One block from the house is a bus stop for downtown Seattle as well as the Seattle Center and the Space Needle on Lower Queen Anne - 20 minutes to downtown/10 minutes to Seattle Center. POSSIBLE LONGER TRIPS BEYOND SEATTLE â€“ include the Olympic Peninsula (Rain Forest), Mt. Rainier, Mt. Helena, San Juan Islands, Leavenworth (replica of an Alpine village).
