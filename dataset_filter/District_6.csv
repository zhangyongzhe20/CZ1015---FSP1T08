Historically it is the traditional center of Seattle's ethnically Scandinavian seafaring community, who were drawn to the area because of the salmon fishing opportunities. It is a place full of some of the best restaurants, pubs, shops, spas, and parks. Each month the Ballard Chamber of Commerce sponsors the Second Saturday Artwalk. There are tastes to please every palate, and the year-round Ballard Farmers Market emphasizes the region's culinary bounty. Enjoy the best of French cuisine at elegant Bastille, Puerto Rico at rum-happy La Isla, and Mexico at uberpopular eatery La Carta De Oaxaca. At the Ballard Locks, you can watch colorful boats pass through and Golden Gardens beach is a perfect place to have a walk, enjoy the view of Olympic Mountains, have a picnic, BBQ, play volleyball and just relax in the sun. Both places are within walking distance. You can rent stand-up paddleboards from Surf Ballard to get out on the","Bus 18 is just around the corner and takes you to downtown Seattle in 15-20 mins.

It depends a lot on where you're going and what time of day.  Getting downtown during the daytime is about 20-30 min, but going east to neighborhoods like Capitol Hill or the University District can take a long time. King County Metro bus lines 15, 15 Express, and D Line are 3 blocks away. 28, 40, and others are about 10 blocks away. We've had good experiences with Uber so far. Uber is a popular ride sharing service. If you prefer a standard taxi, some that serve our area are Sea-Tac International Taxi Association, Yellow Cab, and Northend Taxi. Getting here from the airport: If you're not driving, there are a few options for transportation. First of all, you may be counting on Uber to get you here from the airport, but that won't work. The city does not allow Uber drivers to",17224304,24/6/2014,within an hour,100%,100%,f,Ballard,1.0,1.0,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'linkedin', 'reviews', 'kba']",t,"Northwest 73rd Street, Seattle, WA 98117, United States",Ballard,Loyal Heights,Ballard,98117,t,Camper/RV,Entire home/apt,2,1.0,1.0,1.0,Real Bed,TV|||Internet|||Wireless Internet|||Air Conditioning|||Breakfast|||Heating|||Smoke Detector|||Carbon Monoxide Detector|||First Aid Kit|||Fire Extinguisher|||Essentials|||Shampoo,75.0,15.0,1,0.0,2,10,today,t,26,53,69,69,16,3/8/2015,13/12/2015,98.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,f,flexible,f,f,1,3.1,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True
