","Join this unique friendly lake union live aboard community of floating homes, house boats and house barges. Lake Union is a freshwater lake in Seattle, joined by waterways to Puget Sound and Lake Washington. Gas Works Park is our backyard.  The park sits on the north end of the lake, a 19.1 acre public park built on the site of a former gasification plant, with ruins and pieces of the old plant still standing and built into the park. The park offers grassy hills for kite flying, picnics, and wide vistas of the lake and city. The Burke-Gilman Trail runs along the northern edge of the park. Seaplanes scoot in and out of Lake Union, on their way to and from the San Juan Islands and British Columbia. The lake shores are lined with houseboats, and commercial and private docks for owners and renters of tugs, yachts, tour ships, sailboats, kayaks and canoes. The Center for Wooden Boats is a nautical museum on the south shore, with historical boats, sailing events, classes and workshops.","Easy to get around on the Burke Gilman Trail. Either walk, jog or bike along this city wide trail. Three bikes are provided for use during your stay. Better yet, hop on a kayak or SUP, also provided, and paddle to a restaurant around the lake. Feeling like a more relaxed time, take the 14ft speed boat to dinner.  Bus lines run nearby as well.

Later in the evening, walk to one of the local restaurants or pubs.  There is pizza, sushi, coffee and ice cream, along with an upscale bar and a chowder restaurant all within 3 blocks!

Even closer is Cowen/Ravenna Park with its tree shaded jogging trail, day-lighted stream and numerous play areas. Seattle is a city of neighborhoods - each unique unto themselves. I encourage you to explore the many different communities Seattle has to offer.  Roosevelt is growing! Seattle is experiencing a boom.  More people and a  new light rail station now under construction in the neighborhood has led to numerous development projects being planned or under construction. You may notice older homes in the area boarded up as developers plan for new apartments to meet growing housing demands.","While largely residential we're just a quick car/bus ride to downtown Seattle and numerous other tourist amenities and attractions.

Full kitchen, walking distance to restaurants, market, bus and lots of off street parking.","It's taken me a while to figure out why Fremont has always been my favorite Seattle neighborhood. It has a blend of whimsical creativity, a stellar hillside location on Lake Union and the canal, and continuous things to see and do in a comfortable, neighborhoody way. It's casual and low key, with a lingering hippie vibe. And our wedding reception was at the Lake Washington Rowing Club. Yes, it's on Lake Union, but, well, that's Fremont. The building is immediately located in a very Fremontian convergence of single family, multi-family & light industry, so there are small apartment buildings, single family homes and a busy ventilation company all in the same vicinity.  Sometimes it can be noisy, and at other times surprisingly quiet. For entertainment, there is the annual Fremont Solstice Parade, the 4th of July fireworks plus the year-round Sunday market. Then there are the permanent sculptural fixtures such as the troll sculpture with its VW Bug under Hwy. 99, the Rapunzel neon light ","The apartment is easily accessed from I-5 North & South, as well as Hwy. 99. There are 4 first-come-first-serve parking spots in the apartment's lot. Street parking isn't too bad and should be available within a block. Please note that 2nd Ave NW that fronts the building is rather steep. The closest bus stops are 2 blocks away (Routes 28 & 40), The Burke Gilman trail for cycling, walking etc. is a block and a half away. Walk Score walking rating is 86. Biking 88.

If you don't, it considers itself to the the ""Center of the Universe"" and was Seattle's historic artsy neighborhood.  It has since become home to a lot of high tech and has grown while still hanging onto it's roots.  Hey, we've got a giant troll, an original giant soviet era statue of Lenin, a cold war era rocket that lights up, and an almost life sized model of the planet Saturn.  Who doesn't love Saturn?!?!  Fremont is a very safe neighborhood with many really good restaurants opening all the time.  There are several live music venues that I'd be happy to direct you towards.  We've got a fantastic organic grocery store a couple of blocks away, a gluten free bakery just down the street, and a Belgian beer hall around the corner.  There's America's first (and maybe still only?) fair trade, organic chocolate factory 3 blocks away.  They give tours for $7 every day and all the free samples you can ","All kind of public transit runs through here.  It's about a 10 minute bus ride to downtown from several bus stops, all within 2 or 3 blocks.  You can sign up for car2go and just grab your own smartcar and pay by the minute.  Or, from here, you can just walk everywhere and use the bicycles for the longer trips! If it's between renting a car and using car2go I'd totally go with the latter but, if you do have a car, parking isn't bad considering it's a dense urban neighborhood.  Just read the signs carefully as parking enforcement is ruthless.  I'd be happy to advise you on the ""good spots"" where you can just park your car and forget about it.  Of course, as in most cities, don't tempt thieves by leaving stuff lying around in your car. And also, remember, come and go out the back way.  Have I mentioned that yet..?

It has a blend of whimsical creativity, a stellar hillside location on Lake Union and the canal, and continuous things to see and do in a comfortable, neighborhoody way. It's casual and low key, with a lingering hippie vibe. And our wedding reception was at the Lake Washington Rowing Club. Yes, it's on Lake Union, but, well, that's Fremont. The building is immediately located in a very Fremontian convergence of single family, multi-family & light industry, so there are small apartment buildings, single family homes and a busy ventilation company all in the same vicinity.  Sometimes it can be noisy, and at other times surprisingly quiet. For entertainment, there is the annual Fremont Solstice Parade, the 4th of July fireworks plus the year-round Sunday market. Then there are the permanent sculptural fixtures such as the troll sculpture with its VW Bug under Hwy. 99, the Rapunzel neon light ","The apartment is easily accessed from I-5 North & South, as well as Hwy. 99.
