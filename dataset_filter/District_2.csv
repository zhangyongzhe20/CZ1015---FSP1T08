Plus, I find that I have most everything I need in my own neighborhood; I often joke that I only leave the south-end when I am heading to India (or otherwise abroad).

Despite its close proximity to downtown and First Hill, Beacon Hill has a vibe all its own. Depending upon where you are on Beacon Hill, you'll get a different feel for the neighborhood. The busiest section is on the north end, especially where Beacon Hill meets the Rainier Valley. Up at the top of the hill, things settle down into a nice residential area with a small business district. The farther south you go, the more secluded and quiet things get. Though Beacon Hill is largely residential, there are several pockets of activity in different areas. Beacon Avenue runs the length of the hill, and if you travel from north to south, you'll get a great view of downtown and then reach a small area with restaurants and stores near 15th Avenue.
